              Scrims are temporary treatments that can be applied to Material surfaces for the
              purpose of making content on a surface less prominent. They help direct user attention
              to other parts of the screen, away from the surface receiving a scrim.

              When showing a bottom sheet, it's important to show a scrim on background content to
              indicate it will not respond to user interaction.
